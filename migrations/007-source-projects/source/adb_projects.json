The ESP subprogram I, approved on 1 December 2006, supports the Nepal EFA program (2004-2009) for basic and primary education (grades 1-5) with a program loan for $30 million from FY2007 to FY2009. A capacity development grant of $2 million complements the ESP subprogram I to develop government stakeholders&apos; capacity in policy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supports the preparation of an SSR core document. The ESP subprogram II, approved on 24 January 2008, supports the preparation and transition to SSR from FY2008 to FY2011, in particular a model-building exercise of the basic education extension to grades 1-8 in a few districts, as well as broad capacity development for system readiness.\nThe ESP subprogram III is proposed to support the Government in the implementation of the SSR program from 2009 onward. Subprogram III will cover the period from FY2010 to FY2012, during which the Government will focus on the implementation of basic education restructuring, while model building activities will be initiated for secondary education and technical education and vocational training (TEVT).",

The participating districts were selected because of their high poverty, food insecurity and irrigation potential. They are Kanchanpur, Kailali, Dang, Kapilvastu in the Terai plains; Doti, Salyan, Rukum, Rolpa, Pyuthan in the hills; and Bajhang, Jumla, Mugu in the mountains. As the first large-scale intervention in small irrigation development in Nepal, the project will demonstrate participatory irrigation planning and management and build the capacity of all levels of the government for small-scale irrigation development. Farmers will form or strengthen existing water users associations (WUAs) to apply for project support. The project will provide support to rehabilitate and build new surface water irrigation schemes and to develop groundwater irrigation through shallow tube wells. It will also facilitate access to microfinance support and provide extension services. For farmers without access to electricity who are installing shallow tube wells, the project will connect them to the electricity network. WUAs will in turn learn to manage water more efficiently and equitably, maintain their systems, and apply improved agricultural practices.",

The project outcome will be achieved through the following outputs:(i) rural livelihood improved; (ii) capacity and decentralized local governance enhanced; (iii) rural transport infrastructure extended and maintained;  and (iv) project management improved.     \n\nOutput 1:  Rural Livelihood Improved \nThe project will improve community infrastructure in the 18 districts. This will include 90 school buildings and health posts, 36 foot/mule/link trails, 54 water supply and irrigation schemes, 10 micro-hydropower, 8 rural market places, 10 ropeways, and other community infrastructure.  The project will provide livelihood related skills training to 3,000 beneficiaries from the project impact zones, of which at least 40% are women and 60%, are from poor and excluded groups.   In nine pilot districts, the project will work with existing savings and credit groups, and assist BGs willing to form themselves into formal Savings and Credit Cooperatives and facilitate their access to credit from existing institutional suppliers. \n\nOutput 2:  Capacity and Decentralized Local Governance Enhanced \n\nThe project will improve district and national capacity building to promote improved decentralized governance. The thrust will be on establishing the capacity for sustainable management of rural road networks, strengthening the decentralized management of rural infrastructure, and raising central capacity to support local government bodies.  \n\nOutput 3: Rural Transport Infrastructure Extended and Maintained \n\nThe project will improve 260 kilometers (km) of rural roads in the 18 districts (200 km new and 60 km upgrading). Rural roads of 1,200 km will be maintained in the 18 districts and 6,500 meters of trail bridges will be constructed. The implementation of the road sub-projects will employ labor-based equipment-supported methods, and works performed by BGs will be promoted over construction by contractors. Only those civil works that cannot be executed by the communities may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding to contractors.\n Output 4: Project Management Improved \n\nTechnical support to project implementation will be provided through a Central Implementation Support Consultant (CISC) and District Implementation Support Consultant (DISCs) in each of the 18 project districts.",

    "description": "The impact of the project will be reduced rural poverty in 18 poor and remote hill and mountain districts. The project outcome will be widened access to social services and economic opportunities. The project outcome will be achieved through the following outputs:(i) rural livelihood improved; (ii) capacity and decentralized local governance enhanced; (iii) rural transport infrastructure extended and maintained;  and (iv) project management improved.     \n\nOutput 1:  Rural Livelihood Improved \nThe project will improve community infrastructure in the 18 districts. This will include 90 school buildings and health posts, 36 foot/mule/link trails, 54 water supply and irrigation schemes, 10 micro-hydropower, 8 rural market places, 10 ropeways, and other community infrastructure.  The project will provide livelihood related skills training to 3,000 beneficiaries from the project impact zones, of which at least 40% are women and 60%, are from poor and excluded groups.   In nine pilot districts, the project will work with existing savings and credit groups, and assist BGs willing to form themselves into formal Savings and Credit Cooperatives and facilitate their access to credit from existing institutional suppliers. \n\nOutput 2:  Capacity and Decentralized Local Governance Enhanced \n\nThe project will improve district and national capacity building to promote improved decentralized governance. The thrust will be on establishing the capacity for sustainable management of rural road networks, strengthening the decentralized management of rural infrastructure, and raising central capacity to support local government bodies.  \n\nOutput 3: Rural Transport Infrastructure Extended and Maintained \n\nThe project will improve 260 kilometers (km) of rural roads in the 18 districts (200 km new and 60 km upgrading). Rural roads of 1,200 km will be maintained in the 18 districts and 6,500 meters of trail bridges will be constructed. The implementation of the road sub-projects will employ labor-based equipment-supported methods, and works performed by BGs will be promoted over construction by contractors. Only those civil works that cannot be executed by the communities may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding to contractors.\n Output 4: Project Management Improved \n\nTechnical support to project implementation will be provided through a Central Implementation Support Consultant (CISC) and District Implementation Support Consultant (DISCs) in each of the 18 project districts.",

The project will complement ongoing efforts of the Government of Nepal and civil society to improve water management and the river environment in the Bagmati River Basin (BRB). The project will invest in forming a river basin organization with adequate capacity and decision support systems for integrated water resources management (IWRM). It will finance the construction of upstream water storage, riverbed oxygenating weirs, riverbank beautification, and community initiatives to improve the river environment in Kathmandu Valley\n\nThe impact will be increased water security in the BRB. The outcome will be improved river health and flood management. The project is the first attempt in Nepal to apply the concept and principles of IWRM since its adoption under the 2005 National Water Plan.\n\nThe project focuses on priority issues selected by the basin stakeholders from the basin strategic investment road map. The road map is based on the 2009 Bagmati Action Plan and further consultations with basin stakeholders. The project has five outputs:\n(i)\tEstablished systems and capacity for integrated and participatory river basin management. Activities include (a) provide legal and institutional strengthening for IWRM and formation of a river basin organization (RBO), (b) mobilize basin stakeholders, (c) build capacity for increasing RBO competence, (d) establish a central water resources information system including a decision support system and an operating water quality monitoring network, and (e) prepare a 15-year participatory integrated river basin master plan.\n(ii)\tImproved riverbank environment in urban areas. Activities include (a) remove contaminated riverbed material; (b) construct weirs and provide phyto-remediation to enhance the river&apos;s self-cleaning capacity; (c) stabilize and beautify the riverbank; (d) mobilize, raise awareness, and build capacity of local government and communities for riverbank management and maintenance; and (e) collaborate with the private sector, which has expressed interest in setting up recreational businesses along the riverbanks through public-private partnerships or finance maintenance as part of social corporate activities.\n(iii)\tIncreased water availability in the basin during the dry season and watershed conservation. Activities include (a) construct an 861,000 cubic meters (m3) Dhap dam and complete detail design of the 8 million m3 Nagmati dam, (b) provide rooftop rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge, and (c) implement upstream watershed management.\n(iv)\tFunctioning flood forecasting and early warning system for the Bagmati River Basin. Activities include (a) upgrade the existing flood forecasting system, \n(b) install a flood early warning system, and (c) increase community awareness and build capacity for flood response.\n(v)\tEfficient project management with effective stakeholder communication.

The project will rebuild or repair least 700 schools damaged by the earthquake. The schools that are rebuilt or repaired under the project will include stronger construction and engineering specifications that are designed to help the structures withstand future disasters. They will also include improved bathrooms with separate facilities for boys and girls. As part of the project, disaster risk management principles and awareness will be developed in the communities surrounding the refurbished schools. To get vital social services to the people as quickly as possible, transitional government offices will be established while disaster-resistant structures are being built and furnished. The project will also repair and improve about 135 km of strategic roads and about 450 km of rural roads damaged by the earthquake and landslides. The roads will be rebuilt with improved road safety features and designed to withstand future disasters and the impact of climate change. The long term outcome of the work being done under the project is the construction of roads, schools and government buildings that are designed to withstand the disasters of the future. This will speed up the social and economic recovery of communities devastated by the earthquake.",

    "description": "Electricity is a necessary requirement for accelerating the economic development of any country and is considered an important input to improve quality of life. Overall, the electricity demand has far outgrown the supply, leading to load curtailment and increased dependence on imports from India in recent times. The peak suppressed demand in Nepal in FY2013-2014 has been around 1,200 megawatt (MW) as against installed capacity of 787 MW, hence resulting in a deficit of about 440 MW due to non-availability of generation. Government has plans to generate additional 10,000 MW in the next 10 years. About 63% of the population in Nepal has access to electricity but the supply quality is unreliable and inadequate. The government has recognized the immediate need for reinforcement and upgrade of outdated distribution systems crucial to deliver the required energy to the customers even if the generation and transmission lines are in place. In this regard, the need for immediate distribution network enhancement is included in the government&apos;s action plan to address energy crisis and provide universal access to reliable and efficient electricity for all by 2030. This will contribute in promoting sustainable energy for all (Sustainable Development Goal #7) and Nepal&apos;s Intended Nationally Determined Commitments for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nADB&apos;s Nepal country partnership strategy 2013-2017 supports the government&apos;s development objective of accelerated and inclusive economic growth. It seeks to address the infrastructure bottlenecks in the key areas such as energy services and creating an enabling environment for increased business and employment opportunities. ADB&apos;s support for the energy sector in Nepal has largely focused on generation and transmission with some distribution extension. This project will be ADB&apos;s first investment in Nepal specifically targeting energy efficiency through distribution system enhancements measures.",

Traffic is forecast to increase to 13,000 vehicles per day by 2040, and the rising number of motorcycles creates significant road safety risks, notably as (i) the road winds through the mid-hill region of Nepal and its geometry can be improved, (ii) slow-moving vehicles and pedestrians are not segregated in urban areas, and (iii) the pavement is in poor condition. The road will be widened to four lanes to cater to increasing demand, and design standards will feature enhanced geometry, pavement, structure, drainage, safety, and intelligent traffic system features to improve sustainability, safety awareness, and safety compliance. The road will be median divided, and service lanes in urban areas will improve safety, particularly for women and children, who are more likely to walk, ride a bicycle, or use public transport than men.",

Collectively, 22,000 ha of the priority river basins and 95,000 people are exposed to 1-in-50-year flood. The project areas have minimal reactive embankment interventions, which provide limited flood protection. Between 1991 and 2015, the priority river basins experienced 390 floods, of which: (i) 35 floods caused economic damage of at least NRe1 million; (ii) 37 floods caused a total of 440 deaths; and (iii) 79 floods caused total destruction of more than 10 households. The flood risk is expected to increase as more people and assets locate in vulnerable areas in the Terai Region, which will be further exacerbated by climate change.  The project aims to reduce flood-related economic and social losses in the priority river basins by strengthening integrated disaster risk management approaches. The direct project beneficiaries include local communities within the project area, DWRI, and the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM).

As of 26 April 2015, the death toll stands at over 2,288 people and the injured at more than 5,850 people, but observers believe these numbers are likely to increase.  A United Nations situation report  confirms that 30 out of 75 districts in the country have been affected in the Western and Central Regions, including Kathmandu Valley districts. This includes mountainous and hilly areas, in areas where rural populations are dispersed, as well as some very densely populated districts and Nepal?s two largest cities?greater Kathmandu and Pokhara. The worst affected districts include Sindulpalchowk, Kavre, Nuwakot, Rasuwa, and Dolakha in the central region; and Kaski, Gorkha, and Lamjung in the western region. \n\nThe impacts of the earthquake and its aftershocks in the Kathmandu Valley include collapsed historic buildings in the center of Kathmandu. Roads and other infrastructure have been severely affected, and the delivery of relief goods and services has become difficult. The residents are already facing serious shortages of food, water, and other essential items. Many houses in the worst affected areas are believed to have collapsed. The majority of the populations remain outside their houses due to fear of aftershocks and structural damage to buildings. The Nepalese media report that stores are running out of food and especially water. Hospitals are overcrowded and running short on emergency medical supplies. Doctors from hospitals are reported to be treating people in the streets.\n\nThe Government of Nepal (Government) declared a state of emergency for the 11 affected districts on the evening on 25 April 2015 and has requested international assistance, particularly for the most critical humanitarian needs of the population. This includes (i) search and rescue capacity; (ii) medical teams, supplies, tenting for hospitals, and body bags for the dead; (iii) heavy equipment for removal of rubble; and (iv) helicopters for transport and access to blocked areas.",

Through the project, the road will be upgraded to a two-lane dual carriageway to accommodate the increasing traffic demand, with improved geometry, pavement, drainage, road safety, and climate- and disaster-resilient features. Grade separation or traffic signal will be adopted at junctions to improve safety for vulnerable road users including women and children who are more likely to walk, cycle or use public transport. River training and bank protection works will minimize the risk of erosion. The project design incorporates lessons from previous projects, including readiness, procurement, asset management and sustainability. The project will be aligned with the following impact: balanced and diversified international trade route promoted and economic interconnectivity improved. The project will have the following outcome: connectivity, capacity, efficiency, and safety of the road transport system along the EWH improved.",

    "description": "The Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project aims to improve water security and resilience to potential climate change impact in the Bagmati River Basin. The project will complement ongoing efforts of the Government of Nepal and civil society to improve water management and the river environment in the Bagmati River Basin (BRB). The project will invest in forming a river basin organization with adequate capacity and decision support systems for integrated water resources management (IWRM). It will finance the construction of upstream water storage, riverbed oxygenating weirs, riverbank beautification, and community initiatives to improve the river environment in Kathmandu Valley\n\nThe impact will be increased water security in the BRB. The outcome will be improved river health and flood management. The project is the first attempt in Nepal to apply the concept and principles of IWRM since its adoption under the 2005 National Water Plan.\n\nThe project focuses on priority issues selected by the basin stakeholders from the basin strategic investment road map. The road map is based on the 2009 Bagmati Action Plan and further consultations with basin stakeholders. The project has five outputs:\n\n(i)Established systems and capacity for integrated and participatory river basin management. Activities include (a) provide legal and institutional strengthening for IWRM and formation of a river basin organization (RBO), (b) mobilize basin stakeholders, (c) build capacity for increasing RBO competence, (d) establish a central water resources information system including a decision support system and an operating water quality monitoring network, and (e) prepare a 15-year participatory integrated river basin master plan.\n\n(ii)Improved riverbank environment in urban areas. Activities include (a) remove contaminated riverbed material; (b) construct weirs and provide phyto-remediation to enhance the river&apos;s self-cleaning capacity; (c) stabilize and beautify the riverbank; (d) mobilize, raise awareness, and build capacity of local government and communities for riverbank management and maintenance; and (e) collaborate with the private sector, which has expressed interest in setting up recreational businesses along the riverbanks through publicprivate partnerships or finance maintenance as part of social corporate activities.\n\n(iii)Increased water availability in the basin during the dry season and watershed conservation. Activities include (a) construct an 861,000 cubic meters (m3) Dhap dam and complete detail design of the 8 million m3 Nagmati dam, (b) provide rooftop rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge, and (c) implement upstream watershed management.\n\n(iv)Functioning flood forecasting and early warning system for the Bagmati River Basin. Activities include (a) upgrade the existing flood forecasting system,\n\n(b) install a flood early warning system, and (c) increase community awareness and build capacity for flood response.\n\n(v)Efficient project management with effective stakeholder communication. Activities include (a) establish competent project management and project implementation units, (b) undertake timely procurement and disbursement, and (c) implement the project communication strategy and monitoring.",
